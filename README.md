**Stacked Deep Learning Model for Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery**

This repository provides the implementation of a **hybrid stacked deep learning model** designed for drug discovery tasks such as **drug–target interaction prediction, biomarker discovery, and drug repurposing**.  
The architecture integrates **ANN, RNN (GRU), LSTM, Conditional VAE (CVAE), and Random Forest ensemble** into a stacked model, deployed within a **microservices framework** for scalability and efficiency.
